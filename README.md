# Reinforcement Learning algorithms applied to Gym Environments

The `rl_gym_env` notebook should be probably run on a local jupyter runtime since most tests take a very long time to complete.

The `videos` folder contains examples of agent behaviors at different stages of learning.

The `models` folder contains the models used to produce the videos.
